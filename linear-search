Problem: Given an array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

A simple approach is to do linear search, i.e

Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
If x matches with an element, return the index.
If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

The time complexity of above algorithm is O(n)
